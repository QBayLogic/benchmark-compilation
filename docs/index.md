We recently acquired two new machines in the office, a "workstation" and a "server".
Since we were busy with projects, and the workstation was mostly an upgrade to an existing machine, we decided to run some benchmarks.
Not just any random benchmark though, we wanted to see how well they performed at the job we use them for: compiling Haskell projects.
Another reason is that we assembled our "workstation" based on benchmarks [Phoronix](https://phoronix.com) and https://openbenchmarking.org/, specifically benchmarks which seem related such as [this](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel-core-9900k-linux&num=4) compilation benchmark.
