We recently acquired two new machines in the office, a "workstation" and a "server".
Since we were busy with projects, and the workstation was mostly an upgrade to an existing machine, we decided to run some benchmarks.
Not just any random benchmark though, we wanted to see how well they performed at the job we use them for: compiling Haskell projects.
Another reason is that we assembled our "workstation" based on benchmarks [Phoronix](https://phoronix.com) and [https://openbenchmarking.org/](https://openbenchmarking.org/), specifically benchmarks which seem related such as [this compilation benchmark](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel-core-9900k-linux&num=4).

In the abovementioned benchmarks, AMD's 2700X seemed pretty much on par to Intel's Core i7-8700k; so we decided to build our workstation around the 2700X hoping that its 8 cores would give it a leg up over the i7-8700k's 6 cores in our highly parallel test suites.
Our benchmarks, however, show that we should've bought an i7-8700k instead.
